Have you ever had an excuse to justify your spending? Money excuses cause us to go overdraft in our bank accounts, fall short on our rent, and seek out payday loans to help pay the bills. Excuses are our way of making ourselves feel better when we overspend or just flat-out spend money we don't have. Making excuses may help momentarily but in the financial long run, they will do nothing to keep our finances in order and our bills paid.

You may not realize that you are making excuses for spending money because you do it so often. Nevertheless, recognizing your "money excuses" is the first step to understanding your financial position in life and taking control of your money for a better future. Making excuses for your spending will only send you into a spiral of debt. Turning to credit cards or payday loans for help may be a sign that your excuses are getting you and your budget into trouble. Take a long hard look at what happens when you spend money and be honest with yourself about the fact that you may be making money excuses.
